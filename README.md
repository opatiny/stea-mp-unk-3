## Building an mp3 player in a steampunk style
The goal of this project is to build an autonomous mp3 player contained in an old leather suitcase. It works on batteries, has a 32 characters led display (home-made) and offers an oldschool way to chose the music to play: it uses perforated PCBs with a unique connectivity.

## Results
You can see the final player on this video (in french):
